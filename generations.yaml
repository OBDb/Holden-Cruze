generations:
  - name: "First Generation (as rebadged Suzuki Ignis)"
    start_year: 2002
    end_year: 2006
    description: "The original vehicle sold as the Holden Cruze in Australia and New Zealand was actually a rebadged Suzuki Ignis, a small crossover SUV that bore no relation to the later global Cruze. Available only as a five-door hatchback with SUV-like styling cues, it featured a 1.5L four-cylinder engine paired with either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. Offered with front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive configurations, it was positioned as an entry-level crossover in Holden's lineup. This generation established the Cruze nameplate for Holden but was a modest seller before being discontinued in 2006."

  - name: "Second Generation (Global Compact Car)"
    start_year: 2009
    end_year: 2016
    description: "The Holden Cruze that most consumers recognize was part of GM's global compact car program, initially imported from South Korea before transitioning to Australian production in 2011 as part of Holden's manufacturing operations. Available as a four-door sedan, five-door hatchback (developed specifically for Australian tastes), and later a wagon, it was built on GM's Delta II platform shared with vehicles like the Chevrolet Volt and Opel Astra. Engine options included 1.4L and 1.6L turbocharged petrol engines and a 2.0L turbodiesel, paired with manual or automatic transmissions. The interior featured a dual-cockpit design with reasonable materials and available MyLink infotainment in later models. The Australian-built Cruze represented an important diversification of Holden's local manufacturing beyond the larger Commodore, though it faced strong competition from established small cars like the Toyota Corolla and Mazda3. Production ended in 2016 as part of the phased closure of Holden's Australian manufacturing operations."

  - name: "Third Generation (Imported Astra Sedan)"
    start_year: 2017
    end_year: 2019
    description: "The final vehicle sold as a Holden Cruze was actually a rebadged Chevrolet Cruze sedan (itself based on the international Opel/Vauxhall Astra platform), imported from South Korea as part of Holden's transition to a full-import brand. Available only as a sedan (with the hatchback version sold as the Holden Astra), it featured more refined styling and improved technology compared to its predecessor. Powered by a 1.4L turbocharged four-cylinder engine paired with a six-speed manual or automatic transmission, it offered competitive efficiency and performance for its class. The interior featured improved materials and design, with standard Apple CarPlay and Android Auto connectivity. This generation had a short lifespan in the Australian market, as declining sedan sales and Holden's overall market challenges led to its discontinuation in 2019, shortly before GM's decision to retire the Holden brand entirely."
